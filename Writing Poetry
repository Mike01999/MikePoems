Writing Poetry
For the last month I have taken an interest in poetry. I believe that it can be relaxing and when I get bored, I just do poetry. I’m still new to writing poetry so I haven’t had too much practice on it. Here are some of notes that I have to write a good poem.
•	Think about the title
•	Does it have rhymes or patterns
•	Read it several times
•	What is the mood
•	What is the theme
•	How do you feel when writing a poem
•	How is it organized
Even though I haven’t been written much poetry I really look forward to doing it. It really helps get rid of stress especially when I’m having a bad day. I can’t wait to write more poems in the future because it will help me become more relaxed. Here’s a poem that I have done:

Grow Up
Growing up in this day and age,
With free expression all the rage
Our young ones learn when they grow
All of them will soon sparkle and glow
When they enter school, they’ll make many friends
Hopefully they’ll stay to the very end
They will start with a childish buildup
But soon realize they have to grow up

Even though this poem isn’t long I do believe that it is good and when I write more of them they will get longer.
