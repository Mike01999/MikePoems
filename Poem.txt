My poem

Grow Up
Growing up in this day and age,
With free expression all the rage
Our young ones learn when they grow
All of them will soon sparkle and glow
When they enter school, they’ll make many friends
Hopefully they’ll stay to the very end
They will start with a childish buildup
But soon realize they have to grow up
